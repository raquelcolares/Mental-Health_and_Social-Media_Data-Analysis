A Mental health issue according to the World Health Organization, WHO, is characterized by disturbance in an individualâ€™s cognition, emotional regulation, or behaviour. Some of those issues are anxiety, depression, ADHD, bipolar disorder, etc. 

One out of eight people in the world has a mental disorder,  where anxiety and depression are the most common. 
The social media is one of the causes of the deterioration of mental health. Social media means applications that allow users to interact with each other, by exchanging media, text, etc, like for example Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, etc. 

The social media acts activating a part of the brain of rewards, releasing dopamine, a neuromodulatory molecule that gives feelings of pleasure, satisfaction and motivation; and those feelings cause addiction and are usually associate with anxiety and other mental health conditions.
